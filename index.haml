          Send an EDUshifts book to Michelle Obama and help to build a library in Africa. Or support the preservation of the indigenous knowledge in the Amazon by making sure that Malallah gets your copy.

          Each interaction adds value and more stories to the EDUshifts book.

          **Applying Sharing Principles:** There are 1000 copies available. When they are intentionally passed around the world their reach magnify to thousands.

          Let’s create **impactful connections** and form a **global community** of education transformation. Let’s create an ecosystem of people and initiatives committed to making foundational shifts in education.

        :markdown
          EDUshifts is highlighting a vibrant ecosystem of innovations and solutions in education. We believe in changing the world through education. We understand that offering a more democratic and accessible educational paradigm can broaden the world of people who do not have an opportunity to study.

      .col-sm-6
        :markdown
          This, in turn, helps diminish social inequalities, creating more value in society. The shift in the educational paradigm is also beneficial to those who did have access to the education in a traditional format, but who feel that there are current social and professional needs and gaps that the traditional model is not able to bridge.

    .row
      .col-sm-6
        %h4 Why we are doing this
        :markdown
          Solutions to transform education do exist. Joint actions, shared resources, learning environments and educative communities are becoming crucial for preserving peace, hope and dignity. It is important for such knowledge to be applicable to our current needs. Hence, we create a united narrative of the transformation in education.

      .col-sm-6
        %h4 Who it is for
        :markdown
          The EDUshifts movement is for those who wish to rethink the way we “do” education around the world, and for those who want to see more leaders asking questions about the future of education. It is for those who understand there must be a better way to educate future generations and for humans to coexist with nature on this planet.

          Transforming society means transforming education. Transforming education means breaking patterns and realities that we have been building up for centuries. Does it sound like something you’d be part of? Do you want to share your story? Then [click here](http://edushifts.slack.com).

        :markdown
          In 2015, Tathyana Gouvêa, Brazilian educator and entrepreneur,  and Philippe Greier, Austrian founder of the NGO presente!, came up with an idea of a book about the future of education. They invited **16 authors from different countries around the world**, each one a recognised educational thought leader in their field, to share their experiences and worldviews. They put together what has now become an **EDUshifts Now! book - a manual to the transformation of education globally**. In collaboration with an international team of volunteers, translators, editors, illustrators, designers and film-makers, they have produced the book in English and Portuguese. The book was launched in June 2017 at the CONANE conference of Alternative Education in Brasília - Brazil.

          What are we waiting for? What is holding us back? What do we still need to know? Fundamental societal challenges ask for new approaches to education. Many schools and universities are changing tremendously and opening ways to different forms of education. A growing movement is gaining momentum.  But what is missing to make the education shift happen on a large scale?

          We explore the future of education, the changes that are happening already, and how different communities collaborate beyond existing structures and paradigms. Be it a Montessori model, a Democratic model or a traditional school system model: it is important people have a choice of the pathways they pick to be educated. Adopting a multicultural and interdisciplinary approach enables us to create unique learning environments. As we come together, forming networks based on our concerns about the future, we find the strength and wisdom needed to create a viable human future in the 21st century and live in the world where we can freely explore our full potential and are empowered to make decisions affecting our everyday lives.
