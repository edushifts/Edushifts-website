- title: Six degrees of separation
  description: |
    We are testing the theory of six degrees of separation. It says that we all are connected to each other through a chain of 6 people or less. So let’s send the book to Ken Robinson and see if it works! If you have the book, register it on the [EDUshifts Now! platform](https://now.edushifts.world/) and check where it has been previously. Perhaps it has arrived to you from Africa, South America or Asia. Or maybe it is going there!"
